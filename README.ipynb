    "## Motivation and problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "My aim is to investigate the issue of allergies among children and identify potential causes. To achieve this, I plan to analyze demographic data, which will enable us to understand the origin and prevalence of allergens across different countries. In addition, if time allows, I will explore food data from various countries to examine any correlation between food intake and allergy rates. This research has the potential to benefit scientists developing new food products, government agencies involved with the FDA, and families with newborns looking to prevent allergies. Ultimately, the insights gained from this study may prove critical in addressing the growing problem of allergies among children.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data selected for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset I have selected is a comprehensive collection of children with allergies, providing demographic information as well as prevalence rates. Using this data, my goal is to perform a detailed analysis of specific allergens and their correlation with ethnicity and location. At present, I plan to exclusively utilize this dataset, but I hope to expand my research to include information about food imports per country, enabling me to explore potential links between food intake and allergen prevalence rates. This dataset satisfies all of the criteria that I previously outlined regarding demographics and specific allergens. However, it's worth noting that acquiring this information may involve obtaining data from families or clinics, which could raise ethical considerations. Additionally, the dataset lacks information about how the data was collected, which may impact the validity of the findings.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Unknowns and dependencies: \n",
    "\n",
    "Completing the analysis of the selected dataset should be feasible by the end of this quarter. However, the task of gathering and analyzing data on food intake by region may prove to be more challenging and require additional time. This is particularly true if I intend to compare the two datasets to identify any correlations. \n",

    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we aim to investigate the issue of allergies among children and identify potential causes by analyzing demographic and food data. To guide our analysis, we have developed a set of research questions that will help us better understand the prevalence and causes of allergies among children. By answering these questions, we hope to provide insights that can inform the development of new food products and preventative measures for families with newborns.\n",
    "\n",
    "RQ: What is the prevalence of allergies among children in different countries, and how does it vary by demographic factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, and location?\n",
    "\n",
    "H: America has a high rate of allergies, possibly due to limited exposure to certain foods and contamination during US processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "RQ: What are the most common allergens affecting children, and how do they differ across countries?\n",
    "Is there a correlation between food intake and allergy rates among children, and if so, what types of foods are most strongly associated with allergies?\n",
    "\n",
    "H: In America, peanuts are the most common allergen, possibly due to frequent consumption in processed foods.\n",
    "\n",
    "RQ: How does the prevalence of allergies among children compare to previous years, and what factors may be contributing to any changes in allergy rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "H: There appears to be an increase in allergies in recent years, possibly due to a rise in diets that avoid common allergens.\n",
    "\n",
    "RQ: Are there any significant differences in the prevalence of allergies among children from rural and urban areas, and if so, what are the potential causes of these differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "H: Children from urban areas may have higher exposure to certain foods, making them less susceptible to allergens than those from rural areas.\n",

    "Summary: Food allergy prevalence and patterns vary worldwide due to genetics, environment, migration, climate, and feeding practices. This suggests that food allergy mechanisms differ globally. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention should be customized to each population. Research should focus on identifying factors that cause differential responses between populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163515/\n",
    "Summary: \n",
    "Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, studies show that food allergy prevalence is increasing worldwide. The prevalence is higher among younger children and in children of East Asian or African descent born in a Western environment. Cow's milk and egg allergy are common, but patterns of food allergy vary by region. More research is needed, especially in Asia and developing countries, to better understand and prevent the increasing prevalence of food allergies.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://foodinsight.org/food-allergies-across-the-globe/\n",
    "Summary: The article provides a brief overview of food allergies globally, stating that the prevalence and types of food allergies vary across countries and cultures. It also discusses the challenges in diagnosing and managing food allergies and highlights the need for increased awareness and education about food allergies.\n",

    "How this will change my aproach: \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, coming in with this information will answer a lot of my \"why\" questions. I plan to combine the data I have into various visualizations and with that, the research above, as well as more in the future, can provide reason into why the trends show as they are. Of course I cannot only rely on those three sources, but they are good anchor points into diving deeper in allergens. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) I plan to input my data in Tabluau\n",
    "2.) Add data points to the graph and continue to play around with the different visualizations until I find something that can pertain to a specific research question\n",
    "3.) Graphs I plan to make: Line graphs to show trends, maps to show abundance and count, bar charts to compare countries allergens, Tree maps also to show abundance\n",
    "4.) After making these static visualizations, I also plan to make some interactive ones as some of my questions have to to with time \n",
    "5.) I then plan on diving into further research to see if I can explain the whys of the data. \n",
